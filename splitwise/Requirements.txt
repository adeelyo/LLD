Requirements
Users can register and update their profiles
A user's profile should contain at least their name, phone number and password
Users can participate in expenses with other users
Users can participate in groups.
To add an expense, a user must specify either the group, or the other users involved in the expense, along with who paid
what and who owes what. They must also specify a description for the expense.
A user can see their total owed amount
A user can see a history of the expenses they're involved in
A user can see a history of the expenses made in a group that they're participating in
Users shouldn't be able to query about groups they are not a member of
Only the user who has created a group can add/remove members to the group
Users can request a settle-up. The application should show a list of transactions, which when executed will ensure that
the user no longer owes or recieves money from any other user. Note that this need not settle-up any other users.
Users can request a settle-up for any group they're participating in. The application should show a list of transactions,
which if executed, will ensure that everyone participating in the group is settled up (owes a net of 0 Rs). Note that will
only deal with the expenses made inside that group. Expenses outside the group need not be settled.
Good to Have Requirements
When settling a group, we should try to minimize the number of transactions that the group members should make to
settle up.
Note: All tests will be performed in one go. The application doesn't need to persist data between runs.
